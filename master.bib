We show, however, that only under very limited circumstances will there be an observable relationship between fundraising and challenger quality. Therefore, previous empirical tests for deterrence have systematically underestimated the effects of fundraising in decreasing electoral competition. Our analysis also suggests that by making fundraising easily observable, Federal Election Commission regulations may encourage candidates to overinvest time and resources accumulating large war chests instead of governing.},

The model developed in this paper indicates that there is a simple reason why weak candidates choose to run against incumbents: they do so in order to maximize their probability of getting elected to Congress. Together with the findings of previous researchers, the results of our analyses of congressional primary data from 1980 through 1984 provide strong support for the major hypotheses derived from our model.},

We find that the effect of professionalization on incumbent electoral success is far more pervasive. As the level of professionalism of a legislature increases, the effects of external political and economic forces (such as coattails from higher level elections and national economic conditions) on a legislator's chances for reelection diminish in strength. This implies that legislative professionalization promotes institutionalization by establishing boundaries that insulate members from external shocks. We reach these conclusions by specifying and testing a district-level model of state legislative election outcomes, using as dependent variable the probability that an incumbent will win reelection. The model is estimated with probit using data for more than 42,000 state legislators from 1970 to 1989.},

In this paper, I attempt to explain that variance. Using pooled data on state legislative elections from 1992 to 1996, I test relationships suggested by the literature on uncontested seats in U.S. House elections. In addition, I also look at important differences among the state legislatures, such as level of professionalization, the competitiveness of the state's electoral system, the use of multimember districts, and the institution of term limits. I find that the value of a seat, measured either by professionalization level or member pay, and the competitiveness of the state's electoral system are powerful variables in explaining the incidence of uncontested seats across the states. Region also is important, with state legislatures in the South suffering a higher percentage of uncontested seats than state legislatures in the North.},

abstract ={In this article we determine the nature of the relationship between congressional tenure and the distribution of federal outlays. A popular assumption is that this relationship is a strong one, with senior members of Congress obtaining a disproportionate share of federal dollars for their own constituents. In fact, the argument that senior members are able to perform this feat is suspected to be a factor in the defeat of a term limit initiative in Washington state in 1991. Term limits, it was argued at the time, would put the state of Washington at a disadvantage in the race for favorable federal treatment. Previous empirical research, however, has found little evidence that legislative tenure matters in the distribution of federal dollars, thus throwing into question the validity of popular assumptions about the importance of congressional tenure. By analyzing data at both the state and congressional district levels, we help to specify the conditions under which legislative experience does and does not lead to the acquisition of additional federal dollars.},

     abstract = {Recent work on congressional committee composition suggests that the informational or partisan models better explain legislative structure than models based on "distributive" politics. We argue that in many instances a gains from exchange model, where committees are composed of members representing high-demand constituencies, is more appropriate. The gains from exchange theory of congressional structure argues that congressional committees will be composed of representatives who come from congressional districts with higher demand for the policy benefits that each committee controls. In contrast to previous findings that committees are frequently ideologically representative of the entire chamber, these gains from exchange models suggest that a more accurate test of the policy needs of legislators would incorporate economic, social, and geographic information about the congressional districts that they represent. Census data, as well as information from several other sources, are collected for every congressional district from 1943 to 1994. District profiles on certain key characteristics for committee members are compared with those of the chamber using a nonparametric Monte Carlo simulation (difference-in-medians) test. The membership of 13 standing House committees is examined across 50 years. Several committees are found to be composed of members representing districts whose characteristics indicate that they have high levels of "need" for the policy benefits under the jurisdiction of that committee. These findings, frequently consistent across time, apply to both committees that are traditionally considered constituency service-oriented and several that are thought to be more "policy oriented."},

     abstract = {Public financing schemes are often promoted as means of increasing the competitiveness of legislative elections and changing the way that candidates raise campaign funds. We investigate the impact that Wisconsin's system of public financing of state legislative elections, established in 1977, has had on these variables. Having compared trends in the pre- and postreform period, we find no evidence that providing challengers with public money has made elections more competitive, although it has narrowed the spending gap between incumbents and challengers. Most important, public financing has not increased the number of challengers, as incumbents increasingly face no opposition at all. We argue that challengers consider the overall strategic environment, and not just the question of fundraising, when making the initial decision to run. The availability of public money does little to encourage challenges to safe incumbents. While some changes in Wisconsin's system might marginally increase the likelihood of challenges, we conclude that public funding, by itself, cannot significantly change the competitiveness of legislative elections.},

abstract ={Does complete public financing of campaigns enhance electoral competition? Arizona and Maine implemented similar clean elections programs for state-level races in 2000, providing an opportunity to examine the consequences of public financing. Employing two measures of competitiveness, I find that clean elections programs in both states significantly increased competition in districts where challengers accepted public funding. These findings suggest that public monies do not simply attract low-quality challengers and that access to campaign funds is an important determinant of competitiveness. As a result, while public financing programs are not panaceas for uncompetitive elections, such programs can enhance competition in races where money is accepted.},

The findings here support many of the same conclusions that studies of congressional campaign funding have reached. However, they also indicate that political parties and PACs differ from each other in their patterns of giving when the competitiveness of the state legislative race is taken into account. Parties, not PACs, appear to be the most strategic givers. Looking at contributions from the point of view of the candidate, the authors assess how dependent various categories of candidates were on various sources of funding. Their findings indicate the relative importance of party, PAC, or individual contributions. They find that public funds did not play a role in determining the outcome of close races.},

abstract ={In the following analysis, we provide an assessment of the effect of campaign finance reform on campaign spending and electoral competition in gubernatorial campaigns. The work improves on prior research by considering a longer, more comprehensive time frame (1978-1997) and by examining the effects of several different components of reform (contribution limits, public financing, and spending limits) within a single analytic framework. We find that spending limits reduce candidate spending and have an indirect and negative effect on electoral competition. The negative effects of spending limits, however, are heavily contingent on the level at which the limit is set. Contribution limits are associated with increased disparities in candidate spending and increased incumbent spending but have no direct effects on electoral competition. Overall, whether campaign finance reform enhances or inhibits electoral competition depends very much on the combination of spending limits, contribution limits, and public financing enacted in a given state.},

Yet this reform may impact legislatures not only directly through forced retirements, but also indirectly by changing the incentives to prospective candidates. Following hypotheses suggested by Fiorina (1994, 1996), we argue that term limits have changed the incentive structure for typical Democratic candidates in some legislatures. This change in incentives has, in turn, affected the partisan composition of statehouses just as the professionalization movement affected incentives and partisan composition a generation ago. We provide quantitative evidence that supports Fiorina's conjectures about term limits, suggesting that the presence of term limits provisions even before they take effect creates an environment that is less attractive to Democratic candidates.},

     abstract = {Recent research has uncovered a majority party advantage in the allocation of federal resources, a relationship seemingly at odds with the bipartisan support often enjoyed by distributive policies and programs. We reconcile this disjuncture by developing a partisan blame avoidance account of the distribution of legislative pork. According to this account, the majority party inoculates itself against minority party charges of wasteful spending by including the minority in pork barrel coalitions. At the same time, the majority party, mindful of the electoral benefits of bringing home the bacon, reserves the most valuable awards for its members. We assess this account by examining the awarding of appropriations earmarks to institutions of higher education between 1995 and 2000. The partisan blame avoidance account is supported.},

These findings are at odds with many descriptive accounts of the seniority norm for which such a relationship is a presupposition. Evidence and intuition appear at odds with each other. This study offers a partial reconciliation. The death of Senator Henry "Scoop" Jackson provides the somewhat macabre backdrop to a novel empirical examination of the seniority/benefit relationship. Evidence is provided through stock market reactions to Jackson's death across various constituent interests of Henry Jackson and Sam Nunn, Jackson's successor as ranking minority member on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The results support the hypothesis that a seniority/benefit relationship exists.},

We study total contributions by corporate political action committees at the industry level. We create a large data set on industry political activity, covering 124 industries across five election cycles from 1978 to 1986 and sketch out a simple benefit-cost model to predict total corporate PAC contributions in each industry. The few previous studies of this phenomenon use relatively small samples and employ statistical techniques that are either biased or impose untested restrictions. The selectivity-corrected regression technique used here solves these problems. We find that industries with greater potential benefits from government assistance contribute systematically more but that the ability to realize these benefits is constrained by collective action problems facing firms in each industry.},

Several PACs are found to be motivated by considerations that generally transcend their narrow "special" interests, suggesting that those who subscribe to the special interest stereotype are likely to underestimate the political expectations of at least some economic interests.},

Aggregating 100,814 randomly selected respondents to measure subconstituency preferences provides an unprecedented ability to measure subconstituency preferences in the House. Looking at the relationship over all votes, "key votes" and on individual votes confirms that representatives are not completely responsive to the district mean voter, that only majority party Republicans are especially responsive to the preferences of same-party constituents, and that same-party constituency preferences cannot entirely account for systematic differences in Republican and Democratic voting behavior.},

The number of Democratic voters will be positively correlated with federal outlays, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. The degree to which a program will be skewed to Democrats will be a function of the amount of variation in program benefits across districts, whether the program is administered by formula, and the extent of one-party control when the program is initiated. Regression analysis of district-level data on election outcomes and federal assistance programs for the period 1984-90. The number of Democratic voters is an important predictor of the amount of federal dollars flowing to a district. Programs with a greater amount of variation across districts are more heavily skewed to Democrats, as are programs administered by formula. Programs initiated in the latter half of the 1970s, a time of solid Democratic control, exhibit the greatest bias towards Democrats; programs started in the Reagan era show no such bias. Our results are consistent with a model in which parties in the United States play an important, but limited role in determining the distribution of federal dollars: given enough time, parties can target types of voters, but they cannot easily target specific districts.},

     abstract = {Does the size of their black constituency influence support for civil rights legislation among southern Democrats? Previous research on the subject has produced mixed results. I argue that part of the reason for this is that the voting indices typically used to measure constituency influence are invariably made up of both salient and more obscure roll calls. To illustrate this point I examine scores from the 1990 Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), along with two roll calls of similar impact yet markedly different levels of salienceÑthe final vote on the 1990 Civil Rights Act and a less publicized amendment. I show that the size of the black constituency, as well as other district-level factors, was an important determinant of how southern Democratic House members voted on the 1990 Civil Rights Act, but not on the more obscure amendment or the overall LCCR scores.},

     abstract = {In the last 40 years careerism has hit Congress full force, yet we do not know much about the pros and cons of lengthy congressional careers. I describe the changes typically occurring over the course of extended stays in Congress and then show that these contours have shifted over the decades such that for most aspects of congressional service (electoral support, formal positions held, and constituency attention) there is less differentiation between a member's early and late career stages than there used to be. However, a major exception exists to the diminution of life cycle effects in Congress: pure legislative involvement (raw levels of activity combined with the extent to which a member's legislative agenda is focused and efficient), despite widely held beliefs about the death of apprenticeship, is now more than ever dependent on tenure. In relative terms, junior members are less legislatively involved than they were a few decades ago. While many portions of congressional service are now routinized from the beginning, legislative involvement comes not just with a subcommittee chair but only with experience. This finding has clear implications both for proposals to limit congressional terms and for perceptions of congressional careerism in general.},

     abstract = {A conditional model of committee behavior is proposed to explain variation in committee responsiveness to chamber and party principals. Committee member behavior is consistent with the preferences of both the floor and the party caucuses; variation in salience explains differences in committee responsiveness to noncommittee colleagues. Committee-specific votes are scaled to produce spatial locations for committee, floor, party caucuses, and party committee delegations; a Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the statistical significance of voting alignments. Postreform House committees generally act in a manner acceptable to both the chamber and majority party; the Democratic caucus is frequently represented by extreme committee delegations; members of salient committees are more loyal agents of the chamber and majority party than are members of low salient committees.},

Jurisprudential regimes identify relevant case factors and/or set the level of scrutiny or balancing the justices will use. These jurisprudential regimes have the potential to make a significant difference in the decisions of the justices. We identify a candidate jurisprudential regime, content-neutrality, which appears to govern the general area of free expression law. The Court applies the strictest standard of review to regulations of expression that target the content or viewpoint of expression. Relying on a series of statistical tests using logistic regression, we find that the justices take seriously this jurisprudential regime.},
